# Calculation of Calibration matrix, Distortion coefficient, Rotational and Translational vectors 
### using Zhang's method:  
* Print the image of checkerboard on A4 sheet of paper provided in pdf [checkerboard](https://github.com/pareespathak/visual_odometry/blob/main/calibration/camera-calibration-checker-board_9x7.pdf) and stick it on a hard surface.  
* Click images of the checkerboard from different angles.  
* It is recommended to click atleast 8 images to get accurate results. Greater dataset provides more accurate results.  
* Use [calibration](https://github.com/pareespathak/visual_odometry/blob/main/calibration/calibration.py) code to get the required calibrating parameters.
