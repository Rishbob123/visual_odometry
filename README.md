# Monoculor Visual Odometry
## Introduction:  
Visual odometry(VO) is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images.The project is designed to estimate motion of callibrated camera mounted over mobile platform. Motion is estimated by computing the feature points of the image and determining the relative translation and rotation of the images.
## Different Approaches For Visual Odometry Pipeline used in the project: 
• 3D-2D Motion estimation using Optical Flow method.   
•	2D-2D Motion Estimation using Feature matching method.  
•	2D-2D Motion Estimation using Optical Flow Method. 

# Feature Detectors used:
